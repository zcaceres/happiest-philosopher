# THE HAPPIEST PHILOSOPHER
### Instant Linguistic Sentiment Analyses and Graph Generator
#### A Pythonathon 2016 Project by Zach Caceres
The Happiest Philosopher does sentiment analyses on the text of any .txt file held in the 'philosophers' directory.

It analyzes the POLARITY and the SUBJECTIVITY of any text and generates a graph 
ranking the authors accordingly.

To use:
1) Create a folder in 'philosophers' directory with the name of each AUTHOR you would
like to analyze.

2) Add any .txt files that belongs to that author to the directory. The name of the .txt file is used in
your results graph, so name accordingly!

3) Run main.py. You need a plotly account which will automatically generate a 
graph and open your browser to show it to you at the end of the analyses.
